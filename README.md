### Overview

- Images

**Intro**

This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**Technologies and Techniques**  
The project was created based on a design brief from Figma.
Media queries were used to support desktop, tablet, and phone screen sizes.
Responsive Grid layout was used to move text and images so they fir nicely at all screen sizes.

**Images**

Images were exported directly from Figma and optimized [here](https://tinypng.com/), so the project loads faster.
